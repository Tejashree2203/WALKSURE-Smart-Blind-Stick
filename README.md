# WALKSURE-Smart-Blind-Stick
There are a number of challenges that humans have no control over. Blindness is an example of such a problem. The main goal of working on this project is to bring attention to the world's blind population and to provide them with technological assistance in all aspects of their lives. This condition causes blind persons a great deal of difficulty in doing their daily tasks. One of their most pressing issues is transportation, such as crossing roads, commuting by rail, or visiting other public locations. They also have difficulty identifying obstructions in front of them while walking down the street, which makes it risky. They constantly require human aid to complete the task. However, there are situations when individuals are helpless due to a lack of such aid. Their reliance erodes their self-assurance.

In this project, a solution is presented in a smart stick with a pair of ultrasonic sensors in order to detect any other obstacles in front of the <br/>user . Furthermore, a water sensor is placed at the bottom of the stick to prevent puddles. And a GSM module is used to send the message to the registered user.
